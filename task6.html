				<h1>CONTENT: notes on this 3col Fixed assignment</h1>
				<p>As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is detectible where the div meets the .jpg background. I used the same hexidecimal numbr in the PS doc as in the HTML?</p>
				<p>This exercise uses a main wrapper bakground images as on fixed strip. I get seriouse Float Drop when I resize (reduce) the browser window. I think that is what "display:inline;/* stops IE doubling margin on float" is for, but would like further explaination to understand this comment.</p>
				<p>Is keeping the #wrapper div necessaryin a styleheet if there is also going be separate version wrapper as we have to contain the different background images? Or perhaps this is an example of an inner div as the book suggests? I am still confusedon that detail.</p>
				<p>Even thought i have auto margin sets on the wrapper div, the page still huggs the let side! I've tried it in all of them, but it won't budge?</p>
				<p>Obviously, this footer has a mind of it's own ...It's in the wrapper, but the "clear" seems to be allowing it outside. However, when I remove the clear, it hugsthe bootom of the  header?</p>
